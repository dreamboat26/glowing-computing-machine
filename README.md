# Self-Driving Car with Neural Network Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a self-driving car system using neural network technology. The implementation includes defining the car mechanics, road layout, artificial sensors, collision detection, and traffic simulation. The core of the system is the neural network algorithm, which learns to drive the car autonomously based on input data from the environment.

## Features
- Car Mechanics: Detailed simulation of car movement and control.
- Road Layout: Various road layouts, including straight roads, curves, intersections, etc.
- Artificial Sensors: Emulated sensors to gather data about the car's surroundings.
- Collision Detection: Mechanisms to detect and avoid collisions with obstacles.
- Traffic Simulation: Simulated traffic conditions to test the car's driving behavior in realistic scenarios.
- Neural Network Implementation: Implementation of neural network algorithms for autonomous driving.

Virtual Environment

The project includes a virtual world where the self-driving car operates. This environment comprises:
- Terrain: Including obstacles such as trees, buildings, etc.
- Roads: Programmatically generated roads for the car to navigate.
- Traffic: Simulated vehicles to mimic real-world traffic conditions.

## Usage
- Installation: Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Setup: Install the necessary dependencies and libraries.
- Run: Execute the main script to start the simulation.

Contributions to this project are welcome.
